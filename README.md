# \<loop-editor\>

Web components editor.

This is a rewrite of [Develoop](https://github.com/jperals/develoop) from scratch.

**Warning**: This is pretty much work in progress, and is not a production tool by any means. For now expect just basic file load and save, and even dragging-and-dropping into the stage is rather broken for most components.

## Quick start


- First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed.
- `bower install`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` to serve your application locally.
- Visit `localhost:8080`
